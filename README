Merge support is based on cherry-picking and may not satisfy your needs - but it works.

Usage:
		git svn merge <list_of_git_commits>..
	and afterwards
		git svn dcommit

If you receive an error continue with:
	 git svn merge --continue

See bash test scripts to get more idea on how to use it and what's exactly going on. 

THIS SOFTWARE IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND WILL DAMAGE YOUR DATA!
USE WITH CAUTION!

Known limitations (vel bugs):
 - merge via more than 2 branches is marked as merge from last branch and not merge from all branches,
 - errors may not handled properly in some cases, if you get an error verify that all commits were merged properly,
 - there's no verification of whether certain commit was already merged,
 - there's no support for reverse merges (equivalent of 'git revert'),
 - there's no support for reintegrate,
 - renames may not handled properly (consider using 'diff.renameLimit' set to 0)
